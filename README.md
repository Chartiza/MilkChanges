# 🐮 MilkChanges
Investigation of DHI milk test parameters changing in time.

## Scripts
🥶 *Freez_exp.ipynb*

The script is designed to check DHI milk sample parameters changing before and after freezing. In wintertime, the samples could arrive in the DHI laboratory frozen. We asked the question if we can analyze these samples after heating or if irreversible changes in parameters have already taken place.

As a result, you have Mean Values.pdf and Distr Values.pdf files with the plots that demonstrate parameters changing and the Freez_CorrMatr.jpg file with correlations between parameters.
