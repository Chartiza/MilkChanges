# üêÆ MilkDHI
Investigation of milk parameters from the DHI laboratory of AO Agroplem.

## Scripts
ü•∂ *Freez_exp.ipynb*

The script is designed to check DHI milk sample parameters changing before and after freezing. In wintertime, the samples could arrive in the DHI laboratory frozen. We asked the question if we can analyze these samples after heating or if irreversible changes in parameters have already taken place.

As a result, you have Mean Values.pdf and Distr Values.pdf files with the plots that demonstrate parameters changing and the Freez_CorrMatr.jpg file with correlations between parameters.

ü•õ *FattyAcid_ratios.ipynb*

Script is designed to calculate fatty acid group proportion.
The raw data was taken from the DHI laboratory of AO Agroplem. The analysis was carried out on a FOSS machine. <br>
A total of 13,107 animals from the Russian population of black-motley Holstein were analysed.
